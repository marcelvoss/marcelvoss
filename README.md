### Hi there, I'm Marcel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at [**SumUp**](https://sumup.com) where I work within the Mobile Platform squad. I previously worked at [**Vectornator**](https://www.vectornator.io), [**Ulysses**](https://ulysses.app) and [**Zenjob**](https://www.zenjob.de). I am passionate about iOS development, automation, testable code and server-side Swift. I also like pleasantly looking UI but hey, who doesn't?
