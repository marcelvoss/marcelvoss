### Hi there, I'm Marcel üëã

I'm a senior software engineer at [**SumUp**](https://sumup.com). I previously worked at [**Mercedes-Benz.io**](https://mercedes-benz.io), [**Zenjob**](https://www.zenjob.de), [**Vectornator**](https://www.vectornator.io), and [**Ulysses**](https://ulysses.app). 

I am passionate about **automation**, **testing**, **open source**, **tooling**, **privacy**, and **reusable code**. Want to talk about any of these things?

Every once in a while, I also write articles on my [blog](https://marcelvoss.com/posts) about things I consider interesting, learned or care about. ‚úçÔ∏è
