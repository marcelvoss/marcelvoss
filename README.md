### Hi there, I'm Marcel üëã

I'm a software engineer at [**Mercedes-Benz.io**](https://mercedes-benz.io). I previously worked at [**SumUp**](https://sumup.com), [**Zenjob**](https://www.zenjob.de), [**Vectornator**](https://www.vectornator.io), and [**Ulysses**](https://ulysses.app) . I am passionate about iOS development, automation, privacy, testable code and CI/CD. I also like pleasantly looking UI but hey, who doesn't? 

Every once in a while, I also write articles on my [blog](https://marcelvoss.com/posts) about things I consider interesting, learned or care about. ‚úçÔ∏è
