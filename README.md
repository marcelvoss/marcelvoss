### Hi there, I'm Marcel üëã

I'm a software engineer at [**SumUp**](https://sumup.com) where I work within the Mobile Platform squad. In that squad I try to improve everyone else's life as an iOS engineer at SumUp. I previously worked at [**Vectornator**](https://www.vectornator.io), [**Ulysses**](https://ulysses.app) and [**Zenjob**](https://www.zenjob.de). I am passionate about iOS development, automation, privacy, testable code, and server-side Swift. I also like pleasantly looking UI but hey, who doesn't? 

Every once in a while, I also write articles on my [blog](https://marcelvoss.com/posts) about things I consider interesting, learned or care about. ‚úçÔ∏è
